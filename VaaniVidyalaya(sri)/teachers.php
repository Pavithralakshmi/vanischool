                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am glad to meet you all through this few lines. I wish to share with you that education is a shared commitment and noble aspiration between dedicated teachers, motivated students and enthusiastic parents with high expectations. Vani Vidyalaya Matric.Hr.Sec.School is lucky to associate with all three aspects in abundance on campus. At the same time the world has become very challenging and it is for the one who is willing to do hard work. Our school is giving the advancement of technology and a lot of opportunities too.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Through the good education we kindle the intellect of the students to enable them to think beyond and learn more than what is taught and our school is striving hard to make the best possible efforts in inculcating strong values combined with academics and extra – curricular activities. Our school creates lot of opportunities for the students to excel not only in classroom activities but also in sports and games. In addition, in our school the student’s council at the primary, secondary and higher secondary level provides ample opportunities to many students to adorn the role of leaders.<br>
                                <br>Our school is becoming increasingly aware of its image in the community, our school, be it serving the majority or the minority, has certain priorities set up for themselves, like , reputation, quality education, infrastructure, security, curriculum, design etc. The enhanced image building effort is to have a positive influence on student and staff morale, exam performance and student behavior.<br>
